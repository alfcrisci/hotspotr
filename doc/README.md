# Development Documentation

Currently includes only
[ives-brown](https://github.com/mpadge/hotspotr/ives-brown.md), which documents
the comparison of the models of Brown, Mehlman, & Stevens (*Ecology* 1995) and
Ives & Klopfer (*Ecology* 1997). The latter model is shown to be of no use for
fitting neutral models of hotspot generation, and is not incorporated within
`hotspotr`. This document justifies the decision to ignore that model.
